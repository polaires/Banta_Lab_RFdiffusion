## How Lessons Are Captured

Lessons are automatically synthesized when:
1. **Failure pattern detected**: 3+ consecutive failures with similar parameters
2. **Breakthrough success**: New best achieved on key metrics
3. **Meaningful improvement**: Significant improvement (>15%) from previous best

To contribute to lessons, run local designs using:
```bash
python analyze_design_cli.py your_design.pdb --metal TB --session exploration_name
```
